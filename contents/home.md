I'm **Wesley da Silva Rocha**, a Brazilian software engineer new grad. Currently, I'm creating an online judge called [DOJO](https://dojo.run/) and improving the Checkout experience of thousands of ecommerces at [VTEX](https://vtex.com/).

Nowadays, I'm experimenting being a front-end developer (spoiler: I'm enjoying it!) but I also have experience with different areas. You can check out some of my projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/wdsrocha/).

Feel free to say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wdsrocha/), [Telegram](https://t.me/wdsrocha/) or [via email](mailto:hi@wdsrocha.com). See you! ðŸ˜‰
