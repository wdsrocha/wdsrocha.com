I'm Wesley da Silva Rocha, a Brazilian software engineer new grad. Currently, I'm creating an online judge called [DOJO](https://dojo.run/) and improving the Checkout experience of thousands of ecommerces at [VTEX](https://vtex.com/).

Nowadays, I'm experimenting with being a front-end developer (spoiler: I'm enjoying it!) but I also have some experience with different areas such as back-end, machine learning, web crawling, game development and a few others. You can check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/wdsrocha/).

Feel free to say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wdsrocha/), [Telegram](https://t.me/wdsrocha/) or [via email](mailto:hi@wdsrocha.com). See ya! ðŸ˜‰
