# Inserting visual separators with Tailwind

Tailwind allows to use [arbitrary values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#using-arbitrary-variants "") to write selectors. Here is an example of a breadcrumb separated by the `>` character:

```javascript
<div class="[&>:not(:first-child):before]:content-['>_']">
  <span>Clothes</span>
  <span>Men's Clothes</span>
  <span>Shoes</span>
  <span>Current Page</span>
</div>
```

![A string equal to "Clothes > Men's > Clothes > Shoes > Current Page" rendered inside an HTML page.](https://assets.tina.io/388cd044-c947-463a-aa2b-0bc55cbd986a/til/inserting-visual-separators-with-tailwind_breadcrumb.png "Breadcrumb generated by the code above.")

To reduce verbosity, you can [add the variant](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#adding-variants "") to you tailwind config file.

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
const plugin = require("tailwindcss/plugin");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    plugin(({ addVariant }) =>
      addVariant("between", "&>:not(:first-child):before")
    ),
  ],
};
```

And you will be able to use it like any other existing variant.

```javascript
<div class="between:content-['>_']">
  <span>Clothes</span>
  <span>Men's Clothes</span>
  <span>Shoes</span>
  <span>Current Page</span>
</div>
```

## Accessibility concern

Keep in mind that the `:before` pseudo element is only used for decorative purposes so screen readers ignore them. If the content you want to display is actually meaningful, consider using JavaScript. [See the WAI-ARIA explanation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/breadcrumb/examples/breadcrumb/ "").
