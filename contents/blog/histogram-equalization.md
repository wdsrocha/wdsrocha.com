# Histogram Equalization

This is a Digital Image Processing technique to improve contrast in an image. See the example below.

The first one has poor contrast and the second one has good contrast. It's way easier to visualize all the landscape details in the second one." />

Here are some good explanations on the subject:

* [Introduction to Histogram Equalization (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuVyG4pg9xQ "")
* [Wikipedia (actually good)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_equalization "")
* [Example with few pixels](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~irenek/techpaps/introip/manual02.html "")
